1871

Documentation and resources for 1871 members, including how to best 1871's GitHub repos are organized.

## Unofficial

This is currently just an unofficial experiment. Seemed easier to build-and-show then propose-explain-and-wait.

How We're Organized on GitHub
=============================

### Teams

Besides controlling access to repos, Teams allow 1871 members to address each other in issues and pull requests.

When you become a member, 1871 staff will add you to the following Teams in the 1871 Organization on GitHub:

 - **Members**: All current 1871 members 
 - **\<Your-Startup-Name\>**: Each startup gets their own team
 - **Founders**: If you're a founder, you're added to the Founders team
 - **CustomerAcquisition**: If your primary responsibility is getting customers
 - **Tech**: If your primary responsibility is building shit

### Repos

You'll also be added to a private repo 1871/members. Every member has push and pull access, and each startup has a <startup-name>.md file that describes where they are, what challenges they're facing, who they're looking to hire, etc. We can also share candidates that are looking to join startups. Also might be nice to have a place to post ideas for products or services that members would be willing to pay for.
